Hola Mundo!
<br>
<br>
My name is Hector Roberto Tejada, but friends and family call me Beto. Feel free to call me whichever though!
I'm a recent graduate of The University of Texas at El Paso, earning a B.S. in Computer Science in May 2016.
<br>
<br>
I will be starting my graduate studies at UTEP doing a Masters in Software Engineering with a concentration in Cybersecurity.
<br>
<br>
I conduct research in Cybersecurity, and since I find my research extremely interesting, I plan on posting condensed versions of my experiments and tests here.
<br>
<br>
Feel free to reach out to me however you'd like!
<br>
